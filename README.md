# 📌React Learning Projects
This repository contains a series of projects built during my React learning journey. The focus was on gaining hands-on experience with React fundamentals, state management, routing, authentication, UI libraries, and deployment.

Projects range from simple apps like counters and to-do lists to more advanced applications such as blogs, e-commerce, and authentication systems. Each project is designed to target specific React concepts including hooks (useState, useEffect, useReducer), component design, context API, form handling, and integration with APIs and Firebase.

The final outcome includes a personal portfolio site showcasing all the projects, along with responsive UI enhancements and hosted demos.
